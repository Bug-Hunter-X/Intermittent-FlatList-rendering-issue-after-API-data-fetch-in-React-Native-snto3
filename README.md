# Intermittent FlatList Rendering Issue in React Native

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList in React Native renders incorrectly after fetching data from an API. The issue is intermittent and doesn't consistently reproduce, making it challenging to debug.

## Bug Description

The `MyComponent` fetches data from a sample API endpoint.  While the data fetch is successful, the FlatList component occasionally fails to render the items correctly, leaving the list empty or displaying items improperly. The issue is not consistently reproducible; sometimes it works as expected.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the application using a React Native environment.
3. Observe the behavior of the FlatList. The rendering issues are intermittent, so repeated runs may be required to observe the bug.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring the data is properly structured and the FlatList keyExtractor is correctly defined, along with careful handling of asynchronous operations and potential network errors.
